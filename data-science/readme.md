# Data Science Assignment Overview

**Objective:** You are provided with a sample dataset of a telecom companyâ€™s customers `data-science-challenge.csv`. You have to perform the following tasks and answer questions in a separate `txt` file.

## Tasks / Questions:

### Note: You have to do this in Python

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform exploratory analysis and extract insights from the dataset. Include visualizations where appropriate.

2. **Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into train/test sets and explain your reasoning for the chosen split method (e.g., stratified sampling, random sampling).

3. **Predictive Modeling:** Build a predictive model to predict which customers are going to churn. Discuss the reasons for choosing a particular algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).

4. **Model Evaluation:** Establish metrics to evaluate model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC). Provide a confusion matrix and discuss its implications.

5. **Deployment Considerations:** Discuss potential issues with deploying the model into production, including data drift, model monitoring, and maintenance.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Quality of Analysis:** Depth and clarity of exploratory analysis and insights drawn from the dataset.
2. **Data Splitting Justification:** Clear explanation of the reasoning behind the chosen method for splitting data.
3. **Model Selection:** Appropriateness of the chosen algorithm for the problem and justification of its selection.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Use of relevant metrics to assess model performance and clarity in interpretation.
5. **Deployment Discussion:** Thoughtfulness in identifying potential issues related to deploying the model into production.
6. **Code Quality:** Readability, organization, and documentation of code.

## Submission Instructions
- Candidates should submit their Python code in a Google Colab Notebook along with a separate `txt` file answering all questions.
- Include any visualizations as images or inline within your notebook.
- Make sure to provide clear instructions on how to run your code in a README file.
- Submit your work through a code repository (e.g., GitHub) containing all necessary files.
- This assignment is time-bounded to 5 days.
